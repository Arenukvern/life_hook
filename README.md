# XSoulspace helper packages

This repository contains some packages that I use for my personal, commercial projects and also for learning purposes for Dart and Flutter.

# Overview

## Production and maintable:

This repository contains several packages that serve different purposes:

- **[xsoulspace_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/xsoulspace_lints)**: A set of linting rules and code formatting guidelines to ensure code quality and consistency across projects.
- **[xsoulspace_foundation](https://pub.dev/packages/xsoulspace_foundation)**: A shared library of utilities, extensions, and helpers that can be used across multiple projects.
- **[xsoulspace_locale](https://pub.dev/packages/xsoulspace_locale)**: Boilerplate for localization, keyboard languages, locale changes.
- **[life_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/life_hooks)**: Useful hooks for managing state and lifecycle in Flutter applications.

## Outdated and maybe will be deprecated:

- [supabase_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/supabase_hooks) for supabase state management.
